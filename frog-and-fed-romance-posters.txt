## DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS FOR MAXIMUM MEME POWER

**Color Palette Guidance:**
- Romantic movie posters: Warm golds, soft pinks, dreamy purples
- Mixed with tactical grays, federal blues, Portland greens
- Always backlit/rim-lit for that sweeping romance aesthetic
- Lens flares mandatory (J.J. Abrams style)

**Typography:**
- Classic romantic movie fonts (Trajan, Copperplate)
- But slightly distressed/spray-painted looking
- Title treatment should look expensive and earnest
- Contrast between serious typography and absurd content = chef's kiss

**Composition Rules:**
- Follow actual romantic movie poster conventions religiously
- The funnier it is when played completely straight
- Federal agent should be conventionally "romantic hero" framed
- Frog should be lit like a legitimate romantic lead
- Both should look like they're on a DVD cover your mom would rent

**Key Elements to Include:**
- Fake studio logos (20th Century Frog, Paramountland Pictures)
- Fake critic quotes at bottom
- "Based on actual events that somehow happened in 2025"
- Production credits: "A Portland Joint" "An Operation Inflation Film"
- Rating: "Rated R for Revolutionary Romance"

## SOCIAL MEDIA DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY

**Instagram/Twitter Caption Templates:**

"I present to you: THE FROG AND THE FED üê∏üíïüöî

He was sworn to protect federal property.
She was sworn to be inflatable.

Coming never to a theater near you, because reality is already weird enough.

## WHY THIS WORKS (The Technical Breakdown)

**Cognitive Dissonance = Comedy Gold:**
Romantic movie conventions are deeply familiar. Applying them to federal agents vs. inflatable protesters creates perfect absurdist humor through juxtaposition.

**Universal Accessibility:**
Everyone's seen romantic movie posters. The reference pool is massive (The Notebook, Titanic, etc). No niche knowledge required.

**Humanizes Through Absurdity:**
Making the conflict romantic implicitly mocks the "violent terrorist" narrative while making it shareable and approachable.

**Memetic Mutation Potential:**
Each poster format can be remixed infinitely. Users will create their own versions. That's engagement gold.

**Algorithm Catnip:**
- High visual appeal (romantic lighting)
- Familiar formats (movie posters)
- Unexpected twist (it's about protests)
- Shareability factor: 11/10
