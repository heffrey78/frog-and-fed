# 🐸 The Frog and The Fed 💕

**A love story nobody asked for. A romance nobody could prevent.**

Welcome to the greatest satirical documentation of the 2025 Portland protests, where inflatable frog costumes met federal law enforcement and somehow became the most effective protest tactic of the decade.

## What This Is

This website showcases 9 romantic movie poster parodies based on the real events when Portland protesters used inflatable animal costumes to counter the Trump administration's "war zone" rhetoric. When federal agents tried to look tough fighting dancing frogs, unicorns, and banana suits, the internet responded with pure gold.

## The Real Story

In 2025, when Trump deployed federal agents to Portland's ICE facility, protesters responded with Operation Inflation - distributing free inflatable costumes to create the most joyfully absurd resistance movement in recent history. The juxtaposition of heavily armed tactical teams vs. googly-eyed dancing animals broke the authoritarian narrative so completely that it went viral worldwide.

Notable moments:
- Seth Todd getting pepper-sprayed in his frog suit: *"I've definitely had spicier tamales"*
- The Banana Bloc marching band playing through tear gas
- DHS Secretary Kristi Noem staging a rooftop photo op while someone played "Yakety Sax"
- Jack Dickinson's analysis: *"It's eight journalists, five protesters, and one of them is in a chicken suit"*

## Contributing

This project documents real events with satirical commentary. Contributions should maintain the balance of humor and respect for the actual protesters who used creativity and joy as resistance.

## Context

All content is grounded in documented events from the 2025 Portland protests. The protesters genuinely used inflatable costumes as a tactical choice to demonstrate the absurdity of calling their peaceful demonstrations a "war zone." Their strategy worked: it became impossible to take seriously any claims about violent insurrection when the footage showed federal agents backing away from dancing unicorns.
