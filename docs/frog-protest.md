# Portland's Inflatable Resistance: How Frog Suits Trolled Trump's "War Zone" Narrative

**The Trump administration called Portland a "war-ravaged" hellscape overrun by violent terrorists. Protesters responded by showing up in inflatable frog costumes, dancing dinosaurs, and banana suits.** What emerged was one of the most effective pieces of visual satire in recent protest history—a joyful, absurdist middle finger to authoritarian rhetoric that went massively viral and made federal agents look ridiculous trying to combat bouncing unicorns.

This satirical resistance had deep roots in 2020's federal crackdown but reached its apex in October 2025, when a 24-year-old in a green inflatable frog suit became an international symbol of nonviolent protest. The juxtaposition was perfect: heavily armed federal agents in tactical gear, tear gas canisters at the ready, facing down googly-eyed inflatable animals doing the Cha Cha Slide. The Trump administration wanted footage of crushing violent insurrection. Instead, the world watched a federal agent carefully aim pepper spray at a frog's butt.

## The "anarchist jurisdiction" that never was

The stage was set in summer 2020, when Trump deployed over 700 federal agents to Portland following George Floyd protests. **Trump called the city a "beehive of terrorists"** at a July 30, 2020 White House press conference, claiming federal forces needed to "clean out" the supposed anarchists. Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf declared Portland had been **"under siege for 47 straight days by a violent mob,"** while Stephen Miller told Tucker Carlson that Democrats were becoming the **"party of secession,"** allowing mob rule in their cities.

On September 21, 2020, the Justice Department officially designated Portland an **"anarchist jurisdiction"** alongside Seattle and New York—all Democratic-run cities—threatening to cut federal funding. Attorney General William Barr scorned city leaders for impeding law enforcement **"when the safety of the citizenry hangs in the balance."** Fox News amplified this nightly. Laura Ingraham declared protesters were **"violent revolutionaries trying to overthrow our government."** Jesse Watters claimed **"every weekend is war."** Tucker Carlson hosted Miller to discuss Portland's supposed lawlessness.

But federal documents later revealed internal reports characterized protests as **"low energy"** and **"uneventful"**—one Portland Police sergeant noted he **"couldn't even get one of them to flip me the bird."** A federal judge in 2025 found Trump's claims **"simply untethered to the facts."** The so-called warzone was concentrated around a few blocks near the federal courthouse, while most of Portland functioned normally. The federal presence actually escalated tensions rather than calming them, drawing larger crowds energized by aggressive tactics like snatching protesters into unmarked vans.

## The costume resistance emerges five years later

Fast forward to June 2025. Trump's second administration deployed agents to Portland's ICE facility amid mass deportation operations. The inflammatory rhetoric returned—Portland was **"war ravaged,"** **"on fire,"** a **"crime-ridden never-ending disaster."** The administration wanted their warzone footage again. This time, Portland was ready with a different strategy.

**Seth Todd, 24, started wearing a green inflatable frog costume to ICE facility protests that June.** The frog had a concerned, wide-eyed expression and a bright orange air intake vent on its rear that kept the suit inflated. Todd protested **"day in and day out since June"** because, as he told reporters, **"I am worried about my community. I don't want to see anyone treated inhumanely."** The costume choice was strategic: **"I wear this to show how ridiculous the notion that we are violent terrorists is. It's just to showcase how that narrative is wrong."**

Todd—who identified satirically as a **"little gay nonbinary toad and proud Antifa terrorist"**—wasn't alone. **Jack Dickinson, 26, showed up in a yellow inflatable chicken suit.** A former elementary school teacher with a graduate degree in game theory, Dickinson understood the tactics perfectly. **"What they rely on is fear,"** he explained. **"So by coming out in an absurdist manner, it speaks to them that we're actually not that afraid. It also dismantles their narrative. When they try to describe this as 'war-torn,' it becomes much harder to take seriously when one of them is in a chicken suit."**

## Operation Inflation scales up the satire

The turning point came October 2-4, 2025, when a federal agent deliberately pepper-sprayed Seth Todd's frog costume by shooting spray directly into the orange air intake vent—essentially creating a gas chamber inside the suit. Todd's response? **"I've definitely had spicier tamales."** The 14-second TikTok video got **1.5 million likes**.

**Brooks Brown, watching from Vancouver, Washington, was horrified and inspired.** That night, he and Portland resident Jordy Johnson, 30, created OperationInflation.com—a crowdfunding site to buy and distribute free inflatable costumes. Brown, who'd grown up learning about Kent State where the National Guard killed four students, saw this as **"my attempt to de-escalate tensions."** Their philosophy was blunt: **"If you're going to make it silly and say that we're evil, we're going to make it silly by showing how evil you are."**

Johnson articulated the strategic brilliance: **"Donald Trump is trying to say this is a war zone. If he wants to invoke the Insurrection Act, he's going to have to point at people in inflatable chickens and inflatable frogs and inflatable unicorns."**

Within days, Operation Inflation distributed **75-100 costumes initially, purchasing approximately 150 total.** They set up makeshift costume racks on the street with vertical "FREE" banners, pulling carts filled with 30 costumes at a time. The costumes cost $60-70 each from Lippman Co., a 77-year-old party supply store on Yamhill Street. Donors could contribute $35 to **"provide an inflatable costume for a True American."**

## The magnificent menagerie of resistance

The costume catalog read like a fever dream. **Frogs multiplied into a "Frog Brigade"**—three adults bouncing in unison, posing for photos, becoming arguably the most recognizable symbol. But the variety was staggering: **unicorns, dinosaurs (multiple types), chickens, peacocks, raccoons, polar bears, axolotls (Mexican salamanders), sharks, cows, bananas, mushrooms.** Non-inflatable characters included **Tigger, Stitch, Garfield, SpongeBob SquarePants, Pikachu, Cookie Monster, Winnie the Pooh, and Barney the purple dinosaur.** One elderly woman wore an **upside-down clown costume** and said it was **"the most fun she'd ever had."**

The **"Banana Bloc"** was particularly inspired—a full marching band dressed entirely in banana suits playing brass instruments. They performed during marches from Elizabeth Caruthers Park to the ICE facility. Members got pepper-sprayed mid-performance; one trumpet player was detained. Their music, they said, **"keeps spirits up, keeps us protesting."** One banana-suited protester held a sign reading simply: **"THIS IS BANANAS."** As he told Reuters: **"We're in the silliest timeline, so I thought, why not be silly with it?"**

The costumes weren't just absurd—they were practical. Made primarily by manufacturers in China (costing as little as $16.99 for bulk orders), they featured **air intake vents providing fresh air while offering some protection from tear gas**. They were **roomy enough for layers of Portland rain gear** underneath. They provided **anonymity, preventing doxxing and retaliation**. And critically, they made violence against protesters look even more excessive—as one analysis noted, **"Nice body armor, champ, but you're going to look stupid when you're photographed trying to take down an inflatable frog."**

## When the war zone met the circus

The visual contrast was devastating to Trump's narrative. On one side: **federal agents in camouflage, face masks, riot gear, gas masks, tactical gear, body armor, carrying guns and tear gas launchers.** On the other: **dancing unicorns, peacocks, and raccoons grooving to Cher's "If I Could Turn Back Time."** NBC described it as a **"night circus"** as inflatable animals bounded toward the ICE building. Salon called it a **"candy-colored confrontation"** and **"maximally absurdist counternarrative."**

The protests featured **Twister games on the street, a Bob Ross impersonator painting protest scenes, teenagers distributing pizza, bubble blowing, dance battles, and book readings.** Joy Wilson regularly wore a Tigger costume and read books **"to highlight the peace and calm of Portland's resistance movement."** Someone blared **"Yakety Sax"** (the Benny Hill theme) when DHS Secretary Kristi Noem appeared on the ICE facility rooftop.

**October 7, 2025 delivered the perfect viral moment.** Noem staged a photo op on the ICE building roof, staring down at protesters. Benny Johnson, a conservative influencer (fired from BuzzFeed for plagiarism), posted heroically about Noem facing down the **"army of Antifa."** Dickinson's chicken suit was in frame. As Dickinson later explained: **"It's, like, eight journalists and five protesters and one of them is in a chicken suit."** Someone with a megaphone yelled up: **"Come on down, I've got a Subway sandwich for you!"**

Protester Sarah Cimino captured the core message: **"Yes, we're in costumes to show just how ridiculous that is. It's not a war zone. The only time it's a war zone is when they come down and abuse us protesters."** Another protester in a banana costume told reporters: **"We have these guys in full military uniforms, costumes basically, coming out because the president is saying this is war-torn, blown-out buildings."**

## The viral tsunami and political mockery

Social media exploded. The frog pepper-spray video's 1.5 million TikTok likes were just the beginning. Twitter lit up with celebration: **"Hot take, but this is wildly effective because there's no way you can claim the unicorn suit person who is twerking is a violent revolutionary and not look insane."** Another: **"I love Portland so much. Only in Portland can a person in a frog costume scare ICE."**

**California Governor Gavin Newsom trolled Trump relentlessly,** posting videos of the dancing unicorn, raccoon, and dinosaur with captions like **"WE FOUND THE PORTLAND WAR ZONE PETE!!"** and **"PORTLAND'S WARZONE"** (sarcastically). **Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley** explained: **"Portlanders are demonstrating with joy and whimsy, which is proving very irritating to President Trump and his Cabinet members, because they came here to provoke violence and use that violence as a foundation for increasing authoritarian control."**

**The Daily Show** ran a segment juxtaposing dancing protesters against Trump/Noem statements with the label **"REAL footage from Portland, 2025. Viewer discretion is advised."** Portland Police Chief Bob Day contradicted Trump directly: **"No, I would not say Portland's war-ravaged. It's not a narrative that's consistent with what's actually happening."**

Even Illinois Governor JB Pritzker got in on the mockery, appearing on Jimmy Kimmel in body armor as a fake reporter from **"war-torn Chicago,"** describing the horror of **"people being forced to eat hot dogs with ketchup."**

## Portlanders documented the disconnect

While Trump claimed Portland was **"on fire,"** **"bombed out,"** without **"sewers anymore,"** locals posted their reality: berry picking, picnicking at Peninsula Park, cliff jumping into rivers, watching sunsets. Oregon Public Broadcasting created timestamped photo compilations contradicting Trump's hyperbole. One Redditor joked: **"I opened up one of those free little libraries and it was completely out of alphabetical order."** Another: **"The only war we need to fight in Portland is natural deodorant."**

Photojournalist Spencer Platt published Getty Images showing: a man sunbathing in a public square, a woman ordering coffee, couples strolling through parks. Meanwhile, **internal Federal Protective Services reports** characterized protests as **"low energy,"** describing protesters **"standing in front of vehicles, playing loud music and 'flipping a bird,' and an older woman using chalk to write on a wall."**

The Oregon GOP got caught posting fake riot images (from a 2008 South American protest and 2017 stock photos). When called out, they replied: **"We're not reporters, just bad memers."**

## Why the costumes worked as tactical genius

Constitutional law expert Timothy Zick noted the costumes were **"critically important for gaining attention from social and conventional media—highly meme-able."** Historian Claire Aubin from Yale explained: **"When you grow up in Portland, you grow up feeling like loud, creative aesthetic expression is how you participate in politics. Fighting optics with optics is a longtime protest strategy."**

The tactic had historical precedent. Willamette Week compared the costumes to the iconic 1967 photo of a protester putting a carnation into an M14 rifle barrel during the Vietnam War's Pentagon march—**"Flower Power"** for a new generation. The Dadaist art movement's absurdist, anti-establishment satire during WWI provided philosophical grounding.

**Dickinson articulated the success:** **"It feels like we're winning this. They're not getting the footage they're looking for. They look ridiculous. The work that a lot of people have put in to building a culture of discipline and a culture of whimsy and a knowledge of how they operate has really helped us."**

The costumes created an unwinnable situation for authorities. Use force against dancing frogs, and you look like authoritarian thugs brutalizing peaceful protesters. Stand down, and you admit there's no threat. Either way, the **"war zone"** narrative collapses. As Salon's analysis put it: **"The costumes work not just by refuting the president's characterization of Portland as a city of violent anarchists, but by refusing to grant ICE a level playing field on which to perform their strongman (and woman) cosplay."**

## The context of federal overreach both times

The 2025 costume protests built on lessons from 2020, when controversial federal tactics radicalized Portland's protest culture. In July 2020, federal agents in unmarked vans grabbed protesters off streets. **Mark Pettibone was snatched while walking home, blindfolded with his own beanie, driven around, held 90 minutes, then released without charges.** Navy veteran **Christopher David, 54, approached agents to ask about their constitutional oath—and was beaten with batons and pepper-sprayed, suffering broken bones.**

Those tactics birthed the **"Wall of Moms"** (mothers in yellow shirts linking arms, chanting **"Feds stay clear! Moms are here!"**), the **"Wall of Vets"** (veterans in white supporting Black Lives Matter), the **"PDX Dad Pod"** (fathers in orange using leaf blowers to disperse tear gas), and groups like Teachers Against Tyrants. All were tear-gassed despite peaceful presence.

By 2025, Portland had learned: federal presence escalates tensions, local officials oppose intervention, and the "anarchist jurisdiction" rhetoric was political theater for Trump's base. The costume protests represented evolution—not just protective human walls, but full absurdist theater that made the federal response look disproportionate and foolish.

## The lasting symbol of nonviolent mockery

The Portland Frog became **"a symbol of what's going on down here...the insane government overreach,"** according to protesters. Fan art circulated showing the frog draped in an American flag. Social media called it **"a new symbol in the fight against ICE and American fascism."** Operation Inflation expanded nationally, with activists in Seattle, Denver, and Chicago forming an **"Inflation Response Network"**—a coalition using humor nationwide. Costumes appeared at ICE facilities in Broadview, Illinois and other cities.

The movement's genius was making protest **accessible and joyful.** As Joy Wilson said: **"People sometimes wonder, 'What can I do?' This makes it so accessible."** Families participated—Kevin and Joy Wilson ordered multiple costumes online, their teenage daughter helped distribute them alongside pizza to protesters. Portland's "Keep Portland Weird" ethos found its perfect expression.

**The ultimate trolling came in the federal response itself.** Federal agents knocked down an 84-year-old Vietnam veteran and his wife, both bystanders, then pepper-sprayed them. They impeded ambulance exits. They shot pepper spray into air vents designed to help people breathe. They deployed 200+ National Guard troops (temporarily blocked by courts) to combat...inflatable dinosaurs dancing to pop music.

## Meme gold: The perfect juxtapositions

For meme-making, the material is endless:

**Visual absurdity:** DHS Secretary on a rooftop in serious tactical pose versus one yellow chicken suit below. A line of heavily armed federal agents backing away from a single inflatable frog. A federal agent carefully aiming pepper spray at a frog's butt vent. Three frogs bouncing in synchronized joy. SpongeBob and Pikachu at a "war-torn" protest. National Guard deployment to combat dancing unicorns.

**Quotable moments:** Seth Todd's **"I've definitely had spicier tamales"** after being pepper-sprayed. The banana protester's **"THIS IS BANANAS"** sign. Dickinson's **"They have to post a video saying Kristi Noem is staring over the Antifa Army and it's eight journalists, five protesters, and one of them is in a chicken suit."** Johnson's **"If he wants to invoke the Insurrection Act, he's going to have to point at inflatable chickens and inflatable frogs and inflatable unicorns."**

**The core contrast:** Trump's rhetoric (**"beehive of terrorists," "under siege," "anarchist jurisdiction," "war-ravaged," "explosive fire-ridden warland"**) versus the reality (people playing Twister, blowing bubbles, reading books, doing the Cha Cha Slide in frog costumes).

This was protest as performance art, satire as defense, absurdism as resistance. Portland answered authoritarianism with laughter, fear-mongering with frog suits, and federal agents with inflatable dinosaurs. The Trump administration wanted war footage. **Portland gave them a chicken suit and a twerking unicorn.** And in doing so, they won.
